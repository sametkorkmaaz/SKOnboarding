## üöÄ Usage

Using the library is straightforward. First, `import SKOnboarding`. Then, create an array of `SKOnboardingPage` objects and call the `launch` method.

```swift
import UIKit
import SKOnboarding

class ViewController: UIViewController {

    override func viewDidAppear(_ animated: Bool) {
        super.viewDidAppear(animated)
        showOnboarding()
    }

    private func showOnboarding() {
        // Create your pages with custom content and colors
        let pages: [SKOnboardingPage] = [
            SKOnboardingPage(image: UIImage(named: "image1") ?? UIImage(),
                             title: "Explore",
                             description: "Discover all the amazing features our app has to offer.",
                             mainColor: UIColor(red: 0.22, green: 0.69, blue: 0.45, alpha: 1.00),
                             textColor: .darkGray),
            SKOnboardingPage(image: UIImage(named: "image2") ?? UIImage(),
                             title: "Save",
                             description: "Easily save your favorite content to your profile for later.",
                             mainColor: .systemOrange,
                             textColor: .darkGray),
            SKOnboardingPage(image: UIImage(named: "image3") ?? UIImage(),
                             title: "Search",
                             description: "Find exactly what you're looking for with our advanced search.",
                             mainColor: .systemPurple,
                             textColor: .darkGray)
        ]
        
        // Launch the onboarding flow
        SKOnboarding.launch(from: self, with: pages) {
            print("Onboarding was successfully completed!")
            // You can add code here to run after the user finishes the onboarding.
        }
    }
}
```

### Customization

You can customize each page by passing parameters when creating an `SKOnboardingPage` object:

-   `image`: The `UIImage` to be displayed on the page.
-   `title`: The main title text.
-   `description`: The description text below the title.
-   `mainColor`: The color of the header and the "Next/Done" button for that page.
-   `textColor`: The color of the title and description text for that page.
